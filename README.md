# Sata GX

**_Sata GX_** is an experimental Sega Saturn emulator for the Wii. The original Yabause Wii port was heavily modified and simplified. A couple of improvements (namely CHD support and SCU emulation) come from devmiyax's [Yaba Sanshiro](https://github.com/devmiyax/yabause). The main speed improvement comes from hardware accelerated rendering by using some tricks of the Hollywood GPU.

## Instalation

Copy the current SataGX folder into the apps folder located on the root of your USB/SD card, place a Saturn BIOS inside the SataGX folder with the name bios.bin and copy the SataGX folder to the root of your SD card, there you can place your backups.

## Controller Mapping

Remapping is planned, currently only the GameCube Controller can be used with the following mapping:

| Sega Saturn | GameCube  |
|-------------|-----------|
| D-pad       | D-pad     |
| A           | B         |
| B           | A         |
| C           | Cstick-UP |
| X           | Y         |
| Y           | X         |
| Z           | Z         |
| R           | R         |
| L           | L         |
| Start       | Start     |

To return to the menu press Start + Z, this will close the game.
